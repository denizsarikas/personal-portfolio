            In this section, I wanted to share what I am lack of and what you can get from me. So you are the one who will think about pros and the cons.

            But I can assure you I have great awareness about my responsibilities and I work hard really even if it is not necessary. I hate when people know something more than you and you just sit back so I alwasy want to be beneficial for the people that I am working with so I always work hard not for myself, but for my mates.

            I worked with PHP, Java, C# and Python in the college but after some research I decided to learn React JS. I am mostly worked with Firebase for back services but I will develop some projects with MangoDB too.

            So in this section I wanted to tell you that I am not a master but with each project I am seeing new ways and new concepts to learn. I am always working about one big project and some little missions for older projects. For example: I need to make this section with slick-carousel for slide.
